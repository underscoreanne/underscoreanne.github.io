        <h1>Why this website looks so ugly</h1>
        <h2>My first blog post is a rant about how Javascript is bad.</h2>
        <p>
            The web has become a perverted and money-horny pile of garbage.
            I think it is time for this mentality to die, but it is too late
            to kill it off since it was "around" long before my birth. There
            are so many things that go into creating this vision of the web.
        </p><p>
            For one, Javascript is a shitshow. The bloated-ness of Javascript
            and the scope-creep in its permissions has created a web that
            can suck the data right out of your computer and plumb it directly
            into Mark Zuckerberg's asshole. Although there is fair motiviation
            for putting a scripting language into the web, the way this was
            implemented makes me want to pass away peacefully. So, I chose not
            to put any Javascript into my website and I hope you do the same;
            I hope that someday Javascript will be a dark corner in the web
            standards and that nobody will have to touch it again, but the
            scope creep is just too great -- it's not going to die, it's
            going to have a disgusting child with web3 first. Oh, god, web3.

            Some clients can't render CSS, because they operate in text-mode
            or because they are broken, old, or variously shitty. That's fine.
            That's why this site doesn't have any CSS -- because the mentality
            of making beautiful colourful pretty sites is ugly and
            reprehensible. Keep your sites simple and useful, for the love of
            god -- people should be able to read your sites in a terminal
            emulator because its the goddamn <i>right thing to do</i>. That's
            why I write my posts in Vim in HTML and don't use some tool to
            convert markdown into HTML or anything -- keep it simple!
            Keep it accessible! If you want to spice up the appearance of this
            website, note that Firefox (the only relevant graphical browser
            these days) will let you change the default colours, fonts, and
            sizes of text. Spice my website up as much as you want!
        </p><p>
            Also, this makes it dead easy to use a screen-reader. Just
            saying.
